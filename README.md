# AWS managed OpenTelemetry Lambda Layers

As a downstream Repo of [opentelemetry-lambda](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-lambda), ___aws-otel-lambda___ publishes AWS managed OpenTelemetry Lambda layers that are preconfigured for use with AWS services and bundle the reduced AWS Collector. Users can onboard to OpenTelemetry in their existing Lambda functions by adding these ready-made layers directly.
- Python3.8 layer [aws-otel-python38-ver-1-1-0](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/lambda/python) contains OpenTelemetry Python v1.1.0 with Contrib v0.20b0
- Nodejs layer [aws-otel-nodejs-ver-0-18-0](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/lambda/javascript) contains OpenTelemetry JavaScript v0.18.0 with Contrib v0.15.0
- Java-Wrapper layer [aws-otel-java-wrapper-ver-1-1-0](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/lambda/java-manual-instr) contains OpenTelemetry Java v1.1.0
- Java-Agent layer [aws-otel-java-agent-ver-1-1-0](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/lambda/java-auto-instr) contains AWS OpenTelemetry Java instrumentation v1.1.0



## Sample Apps
We provide [SAM and Terraform sample applications](sample-apps/) for AWS managed OpenTelemetry Lambda layers. Play these sample by steps:
1. Install AWS Cli, AWS SAM, Terraform, and configure AWS credentials correctly.
2. Checkout the current Repo by
   
   ```git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-lambda.git```
3. Go to a sample application folder, such as `sample-apps/sam/python`, `sample-apps/terraform/nodejs/aws-sdk`, etc
    
4. Deploy sample application by, 
    1. For SAM sample application
        ```
        ./run.sh
       ```
       
    2. For Terraform sample application
        ```
       terraform init
       terraform apply -auto-approve
        ```
